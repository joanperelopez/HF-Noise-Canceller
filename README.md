# HF Noise Canceller

This project was born out of necessity for my day-to-day activities as a ham radio operator. The QRM is becoming more intense every day, with current levels reaching S9, so I needed to find a way to reduce it.  
This device is still in the design phase, which is why there is still little information in the repository. As I continue to develop it, I will add more details.
